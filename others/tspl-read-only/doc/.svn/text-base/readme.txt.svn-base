This version(SP++1.2) has been tested in Codeblocks + GCC4.5 and  VC2010.

The document for SP++1.2 will come in two wkees. And some part of the "SP++ User Guide" for SP++1.0 is inapplicable for this version. You'd better read the code in "SP++/test" to learn how to use this version.

Next version will add three part: spectrum estimation,  adaptive singal processing and denoising.
